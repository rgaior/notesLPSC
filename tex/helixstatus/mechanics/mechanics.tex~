\section{Mechanics}
This first part reports on the state of the detectors as we found them
when  we   removed  them  from  the   field.   We  show   only  a  few
pictures.\\  All of  the antennas  had  their metallic  cone at  least
partly  distorted.   Pictures in  the  figure~\ref{fig:cone} show  two
extreme cases: Nono detector's cone  (shown on the left) is distorted,
in the case of Eva (shown on the right) the cone is no longer attached
to the electronics  box.\\ All the antennas are  in similar state. The
mechanics has to be improved.

The second problem we encountered was that water flooded inside all of
the LNA boxes.   Water went inside the box through the  hole on top of
the box (see figure~\ref{fig:lnabox}  left).  Some boxes had still 1-2
cm  of  water  in  them  and  rust started  to  grow  inside  the  box
(figure~\ref{fig:lnabox} right).
