\section{conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item  all the  cones around  the antenna  were damaged,  it  is being
  repaired  and strengthened  by soldering  again the  cone  base (the
  larger diameter of the cone) and attaching ropes from the antenna to
  the cone base.
\item the hole in the LNA box let the water enter and has to be filled
  \\ (done with silicon gel)
\item most  of the LNAs are broken,  the cause of this  failure is not
  known  yet.   We  should  anyway  look  for   a  protection  against
  electrostatic discharge.
\item  some electronics  boxes show  behavior that  is  not understood
  (different  RMS,  variation  with   time).   We  will  continue  the
  measurement and potentially bring back some boxes to France.
\end{itemize}
