\subsection{Data selection}
The  radio baseline  we  observe is  a  results of  several known  and
unknown effects. A daily modulation is due to the temperature and will
be corrected for in  section~\ref{sec:tempdep}.  Humidity can affect a
lot the baseline, but the  parameterization is more difficult. We also
notice some large change of the  baseline that are likely to be due to
storm.  We  present in this  section the cut  we operate to  clean the
data and keep  the period when the baseline is  mainly affected by the
temperature.\\In principle  we could make cuts on  humidity value, but
the  monitoring information  is not  always present.   We  operate the
selection only  the shape  of the radio  baseline and select  the days
when  the variations  are smooth.   The figure~\ref{fig:selectedpopey}
shows  the day  selected for  the  station Popey.   For instance,  the
period around  the 25th of March  was certainly a period  of rain, and
the  baseline of  Chape and  Popey is  affected, thus  this  period is
removed  from  the  dataset.   (The  date are  also  reported  in  the
appendix)

\subsection{Temperature dependence}
\label{sec:tempdep}  
The next step  is to correct from the effect  of temperature. First of
all we remove the time of the  day when the sun is expected (this time
depends on  the station because they point  toward different azimuth).
The  raw  plot  of  the  baseline  vs  temperature  is  shown  on  the
figure~\ref{fig:blvstempraw}.   For  Chape  we  notice  two  separated
populations. This is due to the  fact that we have sometimes a jump of
the baseline. To circumvent this  effect, we reference our data to the
daily average (see Figure~\ref{fig:blvstempmeansub}).  We parameterize
only the  variation of  the radio baseline  with the variation  of the
temperature:
\begin{itemize}
\item Chape: $\rm ADC - <ADC> = -2.93 (T - <T>) $
\item Popey: $\rm ADC - <ADC> = -3.67 (T - <T>) $ 
%\item Chape:  $\rm ADC - <ADC> = -2.93 (T - <T>)  -2.38\cdot10^{-5}$
%\item Popey: $\rm ADC - <ADC> = -3.67 (T - <T>)  -3.58\cdot10^{-6}$ 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fit of the sun signal}
The temperature  correction removes the dominant  modulation.  The sun
signal is then fitted with a  Gaussian function. Example of such a fit
is shown in the  Figure~\ref{fig:examplefit}. A last selection is done
here on the fit output parameter. We remove the day when the fit value
of the time of maximum is more  than 1 hour away from the expected one
and the sigma of the gaussian is less than 20 minutes or more that 1.5
hour.
