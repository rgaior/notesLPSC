\section{Introduction}
The  current  signal  search for  EASIER  event  is  based on  a  peak
detection. To be  considered as an event, a peak  also needs to arrive
in coincidence with the trigger given by the particle signal and above
a fixed threshold.  It is robust  but it is not the best technique for
the search of small signals.  We study in this note the improvement of
the signal  to noise  ratio when  a matched filter  is applied  to the
radio trace.  %% This method can be applied to all type of EASIER
%% detectors  (EASIER/GD  C-band/GD helix).
\\ In  the first section  we present briefly the  detector simulations
needed  to   test  the   effect  of  the   filters.   Then   we  study
quantitatively    the   improvement    in   sensitivity    with   mock
signals. Finally, we apply these methods to realistic simulation data.
