\section{Simulated data}
\subsection{Data set}
The data set  I used was supplied by Imen  and simulated according the
method described in~\cite{olivierimen}  with an additional factor $\rm
\frac{1}{2}$  due to  the  polarization. The  data  set contains  1000
events drawn in  a GIGADuck array. The energy,  zenith and distance to
shower      axis     distributions      are      shown     in      the
figure~\ref{fig:distributions}.\\
