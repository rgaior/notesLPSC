\section{Simulated data}
\subsection{Data set}
The studied  data set  was supplied  by Imen and  the radio  signal is
simulated according the method described in~\cite{olivierimen} with an
additional factor $\rm \frac{1}{2}$ due to the polarization. The radio
signal is  the microwave  power as  a function of  time. The  data set
contains 1000 events drawn in a GIGADuck array. The energy, zenith and
distance   to   shower   axis   distributions   are   shown   in   the
figure~\ref{fig:distributions}, and examples  of simulated power trace
in the figure~\ref{fig:powertrace}. We apply the matched filter method
to the data set.
