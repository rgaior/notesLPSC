\section*{conclusion}
We  have  gone  through  the  different step  to  simulate  an  EASIER
waveform.  In  particular, we  have detailed the  generation of  an RF
waveform from a realistic spectrum. We also improved the simulation of
the  adaptation  electronics. The  full  simulation  is then  compared
against  data looking at  the traces  fluctuation in  ADC.  We  find a
simulated waveform overestimated the  fluctuation by a small number of
ADC.
