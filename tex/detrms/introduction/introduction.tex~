\section*{Introduction}
The EASIER detectors  goal is to measure the emission  from EAS in the
radio frequencies.  Each EASIER detector  is integrated in an Auger SD
and is composed  of antenna and an amplifier,  a power detection level
to transform  the HF  signal into its  power level, and  an adaptation
board to fit  the Auger SD acquistion front end.\\  We review here the
method of the detector's simulation  in the C-band. We will first look
at the power detection and  adaptation board simulation.  Then we will
step back in  the chain to focus on the HF  waveform simulation from a
frequency spectrum.  Finally we will  compare the simulation  with the
data.\\

\section*{EASIER detectorS}
Before going  into the  detail of the  simulation, we remind  the main
differences  between  the three  setups  that  were  installed in  the
C-band.   Three  different  detector  type were  installed,  the  main
difference is the antenna, but there  is also the presence or not of a
capacitor after  the power detector  that was removed after  the first
setup. The  table \ref{tab:easierdetectors} shows  the main difference
between those setups.

%% The detector is integrated into  an Auger surface detector, i.e. it is
%% physically attached to  it and makes use of  the tank's trigger, power
%% supply  and acquisition.  Several  bands were  explored, the  VHF band
%% (30-80MHz), the  L-band (1-1.4 GHz)  and the C-band (3.4-4.2  GHz). We
%% focus here only on the C-band. 
%%  In this frequency band, three types of
%% detector  were  installed they  can  be  distinguished  mainly by  the
%% antenna used: the first array is composed of seven antennas We review
%% here the simulation  method for EASIER signal from  the radio spectrum
%% to the ADC trace.  Studies were already done on that subject, but push
%% here a  little further the  s A similar  study was already done  in my
%% thesis.  We  have implemented new  method of simulation for  the power
%% detector  and a more  precise way  to simulate  the EASIER  board.  We
%% looked  at  other  methods  for  the  power  detector  simulation  and
%% implemented a  more precise  way to simulate  the EASIER  board. \\The
%% motivation for this  study was to reproduce the RMS  of the data trace
%% with simulation in ADC. This is presented The new step is presented in
%% the second  section where  the data and  the simulation  are compared.
%% For this purpose  we use the RMS  of the radio signal in  ADC.  In the
%% last part we study the meaning  of the sigma mu ratio, i.e.  the ratio
%% of the noise fluctuation and the baseline value.
